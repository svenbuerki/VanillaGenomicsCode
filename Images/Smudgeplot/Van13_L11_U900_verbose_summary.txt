1n coverage estimates (Coverage of every haplotype; Don't confuse with genome coverage which is (ploidy * 1n coverage).)
* User defined 1n coverage:	
* Subset 1n coverage estimate:	29.3
* Highest peak 1n coverage estimate:	32.2
1n coverage used in smudgeplot (one of the three above):	32.2
* Proposed ploidy:	2
* Minimal number of heterozygous loci:	2734172
Note: This number is NOT an estimate of the total number heterozygous loci, it's merly setting the lower boundary if the inference of heterozygosity peaks is correct.
* Proportion of heterozygosity carried by pairs in different genome copies (table)
